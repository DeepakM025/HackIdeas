Setup:

Take a pull from git or download zip
and run npm install in the project base
after that run npm start

How it works - 

By default it will land on login page on load.
You can use any text or number with maximum length 5 to login ex: "12345" or "hdd12".
Since i am using localstorage as my database you cannot see pre filled data so you have to create a data by clicking "CREATE YOUR HACKIDEA" button
Post that you will see a form with title, tags and description inputs. You can fill them and submit
To use the predefined tags that you see below in red color you just have to click on it.
And to add new tag of your own you need to fill that input and click add button.
to remove tag click on the filled tag which is in green color.
And click on HACKIDEA logo to come to dashboard you will get to see your record with timestamp and your logged in ID.
You can upvote by clicking upvote button.
to logout you can use logout button right side of navbar.

Please note : 

I did this in 2 days post office hours.
I do not have experience in TDD so i didn't try and mess it up.
I always think i can do better and my best yet to come.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
